# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis

##Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

I worked with a full year of sales data from an online electronics store, which included details like order IDs, products sold, quantities, prices, dates, and purchase locations. Using this data, I explored and answered some important business questions:

Which month had the best sales ?

Which city brought in the highest number of sales?

What time of day should the company run ads to boost chances of customers buying?

Which products are frequently bought together, hinting at potential bundles?
